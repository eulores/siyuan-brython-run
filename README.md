# brython-run - a widget for SiYuan

Inspired by the widgets [brython-editor](https://github.com/Zuoqiu-Yingyi/widget-brython-editor) and [brython-console](https://github.com/Zuoqiu-Yingyi/widget-brython-console), here's [brython-run](https://github.com/eulores/siyuan-brython-run)

Python code is written inside code sections in [SiYuan](https://b3log.org/siyuan/en/), and executed at the press of a button.

## Installation

The widget can be installed from within SiYuan. Go to settings (Alt+P), select `Bazaar` on the left column, switch to the `Widget` tab and find `brython-run`. 

## Usage

Inside SiYuan, on a new line, insert the `brython-run` widget. Once you click on the `Initialize` button, there will be a python code section with sample code created just above. Also, the label on the button now changes to `Run Python code`.

The label of the button and the link to the code section are stored as custom attributes attached to the widget block.
